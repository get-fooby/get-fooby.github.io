I've been a hacker in the true sense for most of my life. Be it Excel macro's to exploit a Windows 3.1 network back in the day or to more modern uses with projects involving the Raspberry Pi, Software Defined Radio and sniffing 433MHz to create housewide electricity monitoring solutions.

I've recently become a penetration tester for a leading company in the U.K and intend to continue to document things I encounter.
